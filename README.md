#First-Module Challenge

I made some adjustments to the code in order to increase accessibility and optimize it for search engines. I changed many of the div elements to more specific elements in the HTML to help organize the code better. Then, I reorgainzed the CSS code to make it follow along logically with the HTML. I added alt attributes to the images for accessibility with screen readers. I made sure heading elements were in sequential order, and I finished by adding a conside title to describe the site.
